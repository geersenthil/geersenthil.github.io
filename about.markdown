I’m interested in software development and data engineering. I have practical experience in both fields at companies like the Ministry of Attorney General and PepsiCo, where I worked in data science roles. My Preferred Languages are:
Ruby on Rails for Backend Development
JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Frontend Development
Python for Data Processing & Analysis
Java for Object Oriented Programming
I’m currently delving into machine learning concepts like natural language processing.
