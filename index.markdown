<h1>Hi, I’m Geerthika Senthil</h1>
<div><im>img src="img\Profile_pic.jpg">  </div>
I’m interested in software development and data engineering. 
I have practical experience in both fields at companies like the Ministry of Attorney General and PepsiCo, where I worked in data science roles. 
My Preferred Languages are:
Ruby on Rails for Backend Development
JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Frontend Development
Python for Data Processing & Analysis
Java for Object Oriented Programming

I’m currently delving into machine learning concepts like natural language processing.
