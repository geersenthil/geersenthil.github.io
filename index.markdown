        I’m interested in software development and data engineering. 
        I have practical experience in both fields at companies like the Ministry of Attorney General and PepsiCo, where I worked in data science roles. 
        My Preferred Languages are:
            <li>Ruby on Rails for Backend Development</li>
            <li>JavaScript, HTML and CSS for Frontend Development</li>
            <li>Python for Data Processing & Analysis</li>
            <li>Java for Object Oriented Programming</li>

        I’m currently delving into machine learning concepts like natural language processing.</p>
